# Constellations

a simple static website to show the images of constellations as shown in https://stellarium.org when a different culture is selected.

## Todo

- REFACTOR
- add an about page describing this
- try parsing & showing the culture descriptions
- maybe try to organize the source repo a bit ?
- change deployment - make it run in python directly
- google, sharing stuff (whew)

- list cultures (also ?) per region
- some kind of search ? (huh, javascript ... or google / someone else ? might be better for starters )
- fetch culture list from github, somehow discern those w/out pictures
- add next / previous to culture page
- "proper behavior" - alts on images, links ...

## issues
- gitcdn does a nasty redirect to hash (?) - takes extra 300ms

## NTH

- show constellations that are around similar stars in other cultures
- overlay with stars (not sure it makes sense though)
- link to the stellarium web for each constellation (<- that would be excellent)
- tweetbot to publish 1 constellation daily (?) w/ a link
- publish thumbs upstream
- t-shirts :) or something ...
- FIND MORE ART ?! - Africa ?

## done
- add thumbnails
